Project name: TransformerX

Breif description: This project contains a Robot that can transform into a car and
transfrom back to a Robot.

This folder contains three Assembly files:

TransfromerX_MainAssembly    # The Main Assembly
TransfromerX_CarMode       # The Car mode
TransfromerX_StationaryMode # A stationary mode where nothing can move and all parts are collapsed

Because it takes a while to transform the car mode into a robot 
mode (and reverse), due to lots of mates needed to be suppressed or
unsuppressed, I am here presenting the Robot mode and Car mode in
separate assembly files for easier reference.

Number of parts : 26
Number of parts (counting Axises and Lockers as one single part) : 20

Notice about drawings:

Detail Drawing is a drawing for part "Leg1"
Exploded Assembly Drawing is made in TransfromerX_StationaryMode
